üëã About Me

Hello! I'm Phung Tran Mai Ha, you can call me Jane, a passionate and motivated aspiring software developer looking to kick-start my career through an internship opportunity. I'm committed to learning and contributing in the world of technology.

üåç I'm currently pursuing my Information Technology - Front End - at FPT University, and my journey into the world of programming began during my studies. 

I'm deeply committed to personal and professional growth. GitHub is my platform for sharing my coding journey, collaborating on exciting projects, and connecting with like-minded individuals. I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects and actively expand my knowledge.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching science fiction movies and researching planets as a hobby, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I'm a firm believer in the power of technology to drive positive change and innovation.

I'm on the lookout for an internship opportunity that will allow me to apply my skills, learn from experienced professionals, and make a meaningful impact. Let's connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team!
